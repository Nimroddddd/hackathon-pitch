            â€¢ <span className="underline">Emotional Trading</span>: Emotional trading occurs when traders make decisions based on their 
            emotions rather than logical analysis. This can lead to impulsive trades, excessive risk-taking, and ultimately, losses.
            The Tradegent Agent is here to fix that major problem by prompting users for their desired trading behaviours, and makes
            relevant trades on behalf of them using the collected data.
